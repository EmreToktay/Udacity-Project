## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. What is the most commonly used Programming Language  from 2020-2022 for Turkish Data Scientists?
2. What integrated development environment did each Programming Language use for Turkish Data Scientists from 2020 to 2022?
3. Is there a relationship between company size and salary for Turkish developers in 2022?
4. Showing the relationship between firm size and salaries as well as descriptive data, such as the highest salary, lowest salary, and most constant salary range for Turkish Developers in 2022.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.
